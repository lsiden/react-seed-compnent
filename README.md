# react-seed-component

Bare-bones starter project for a React component using Webpack, Babel, Jest, and Enzyme.

## Description

Start your react component from this seed project.

It is based on my [react-seed-app](https://github.com/lsiden/react-seed-app) project
but has no HTML file to serve.  Instead it exposes a component.

## Instructions

1. Clone or copy this project and rename it.
1. Globally rename 'react-seed-component'.
1. Globally rename 'ReactSeedComponent'.
1. Change the names of the .js and .spec.js files to match the name of your new component.
1. Start testing and coding.
1. Publish your component (optional).
1. Expose more components (optional).

To use your component, insert into your [package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json) file a line like

	"dependencies": {
		"my-component": "npm name or URI of my-component repository"
	}

If you prefer to use other tools for writing and running unit tests,
feel free to replace jest and enzyme.
You may have to configure them.
